## About Airam
Airam is an easy-to-start web development framework, focused on providing the developer with an understandable environment using familiar template syntax and Component-oriented flow, router-centric, and looking similar to the early days of Angular2.

- Router based on FastRouter.
- Dependency injection container accessible from the application instance.
- Fast template engine optimized for production.
